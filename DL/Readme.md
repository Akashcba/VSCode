Neural Machine Translation Using sequence - sequence (Attention) Models
```python
models.py => Proposed Model Structure
test.py => Testing File for the model.
train.py => Training file for the model.
utils.py => contains utility functions for developing the vocabulory of the model.
### Reduced Dataset => dataset with a corpus size of 90K (reduced because of hardware limitations)
models_95k.pt => model file saved after training
```
